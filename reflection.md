- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
It makes it much more efficient to make child classes, makes for an easy way to not have to keep writing the same bits of code

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Once again(and I'm starting to see a theme here) I procrastinated a bit too much but the instructions were very clear so once I did it it didn't take too long. I wrote out a plan for all the things I had to do which was very helpful for me, and I'd definitely reccommend it.
